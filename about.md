  Hey there! This is my <strong>first</strong> personal website for front-end programming practicing and back-end notes keeping;
  trip plannings will be updated here occasionally as well.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Yunhan-Zheng/lmdolphy/issues/new) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DolphyYunhan).
Thanks for reading!

Fun fact:

I've created, with the help from my classmates, a [Powtoon clip](https://www.powtoon.com/online-presentation/dqfOS3CECpe/?mode=movie) on *Netflix* with over *10K* views on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWwSS6nrfQM&feature=em-upload_owner). Learn some business while coding!
