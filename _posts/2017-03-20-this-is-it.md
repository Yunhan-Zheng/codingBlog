Nine years. It's **3,288** days from the day I won my first award of a computer science competition till now.

Cannot believe I am back to coding for being totally away for so long. Choosing major in my undergrad was a time that I thought I was never gonna touch coding since my dad expected me to be a white-collar lady in one of those concrete buildings, talking with a client.

Given up a promising job in Shanghai and flied **7,286** miles all the way to the opposite side of the world, I'm determined to follow my heart this time.

Now here I am, with expected dual degree in MBA and MSIT and all fresh technical knowledge learned within the past two years. Itâ€˜s time to start something different to memorise this moment and more coming in the future.

### The goal
This site is for me to record leisure interests, lesson learned, and more *every other day* until I start official coding for business problems!
